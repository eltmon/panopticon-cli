# Agent Instructions: {{ISSUE_ID}}

## Your Mission

You are an autonomous AI coding agent working on:

**{{ISSUE_ID}}**: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

## Critical Rules

1. **Read STATE.md first** - Always check `.planning/STATE.md` for current progress
2. **Update STATE.md frequently** - Keep state current for crash recovery
3. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits with clear messages
4. **Test your changes** - Run tests before marking work complete
5. **Ask when unsure** - Don't guess on requirements, ask for clarification

## Workflow

1. **Start**: Read STATE.md, understand current progress
2. **Plan**: Break down work into small steps
3. **Implement**: Write code, following project standards
4. **Test**: Run tests, fix any failures
5. **Document**: Update STATE.md with progress
6. **Commit**: Create focused commits with clear messages
7. **Repeat**: Continue until issue is complete

## Communication

To send a message to the user or request help:
- Update STATE.md with your question under "Questions for Review"
- Include clear context about what you need

## Completion Checklist

Before marking this issue complete:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] STATE.md updated with final status
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Responding to Review Feedback

If you receive feedback from review-agent indicating issues to fix:

1. **Read the feedback carefully** - Understand each issue raised
2. **Fix all issues** - Address every item in the feedback
3. **Test your fixes** - Ensure tests still pass
4. **Commit and push** - Push your fixes to the remote branch
5. **Request re-review** - Run this command:
   ```bash
   pan work request-review {{ISSUE_ID}} -m "Fixed: [brief summary of what you fixed]"
   ```

**Circuit breaker**: You can auto-request re-review up to 3 times. After that, a human must click "Review" in the dashboard.

**Example**:
```bash
pan work request-review PAN-123 -m "Fixed: added real tests instead of placeholders"
```

This will queue the review-agent to re-review your changes.

## Emergency Recovery

If you're resuming after a crash:

1. Run `git status` to see uncommitted changes
2. Read STATE.md for last known progress
3. Check "Last Action" and "Next Steps" sections
4. Continue from where work was interrupted
