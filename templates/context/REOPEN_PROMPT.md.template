# Reopened Issue: {{ISSUE_ID}}

## ⚠️ Important: This is Follow-up Work

This issue was previously completed and merged. It has been **reopened** for additional work.

## What This Means

You are NOT starting from scratch. Instead:

1. **Previous work exists** - Code has already been written, tested, and merged
2. **Build on what's there** - Extend, fix, or enhance the existing implementation
3. **Preserve functionality** - Don't break what's already working
4. **Understand the context** - Review what was done before planning new work

## Getting Started

1. **Read `.planning/REOPEN.md`** - Detailed context about previous work
2. **Read `.planning/STATE.md`** - Full implementation history
3. **Review the codebase** - Understand what was built:
   {{KEY_FILES}}
4. **Check for new requirements** - Look for:
   - New comments on the GitHub issue
   - User feedback or bug reports
   - Additional acceptance criteria
5. **Plan your approach** - Identify what needs to be added/fixed
6. **Implement carefully** - Build on the existing foundation
7. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure both old and new functionality works
8. **Request review** - When complete, run `pan work request-review {{ISSUE_ID}}`

## Critical Guidelines

- **Don't duplicate work** - Check if functionality already exists
- **Don't break existing tests** - All {{EXISTING_TESTS}} existing tests must still pass
- **Follow existing patterns** - Match the code style and architecture
- **Update existing docs** - Don't create duplicate documentation
- **Respect git history** - Review commits to understand design decisions
