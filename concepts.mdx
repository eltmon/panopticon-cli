# Core Concepts

Learn the fundamental concepts that power Panopticon's multi-agent orchestration.

## Agents

Agents are autonomous AI coding assistants that work independently on tasks. Panopticon spawns agents in tmux sessions, allowing you to:

- **Monitor them in real-time** - See what they're working on via the dashboard
- **Send messages** - Provide feedback or guidance as they work
- **Manage multiple agents** - Run several agents simultaneously on different issues
- **Track their work** - See costs, runtime, and outcomes

Agents can be:
- **Implementation agents** - Work on features, bugs, refactoring
- **Planning agents** - Explore codebases and create implementation plans
- **Specialist agents** - Focus on specific tasks (review, testing, merging)

## Workspaces

**Workspaces are git worktrees** - isolated working directories for each issue/feature. Each workspace:

- Has its own feature branch (e.g., `feature/min-123-add-login`)
- Shares git history with the main repo (no separate clone)
- Can run independently (separate node_modules, builds, etc.)
- Is located at `{project}/workspaces/{issue-id}/`

This allows multiple agents to work on different features simultaneously without conflicts.

### Main Project Branch Convention

The main project directory should **ALWAYS** stay on the `main` branch. All feature work happens in workspaces (git worktrees), never in the main project.

- **Main project**: Always on `main` - serves as the stable reference point
- **Workspaces**: Each has its own feature branch checked out
- **Want to check something?** Create a worktree, don't checkout in main
- **Quick test?** Create a worktree
- **Emergency hotfix?** Create a worktree

This convention ensures:
1. Specialists (review-agent, test-agent) always find the correct code
2. Merge operations have a clean target
3. Multiple agents don't interfere with each other

### Docker Integration

Workspaces can include Docker containers for full development environments. The `--docker` flag automatically:

1. Creates the workspace (git worktree)
2. Looks for docker-compose files
3. Starts containers with unique project names to avoid conflicts

Each workspace gets a unique Docker Compose project name:
- Format: `{project-name}-feature-{issue-id}` (e.g., `mind-your-now-feature-min-123`)
- Allows multiple workspaces to run simultaneously without port conflicts

## Skills

Skills are reusable workflows and best practices that work across all AI tools. They're written once in a standard format and synced to:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Cursor
- Gemini CLI
- Google Antigravity

Skills provide:
- **Standard workflows** - Feature development, bug fixing, code review
- **Best practices** - Security checks, performance optimization
- **Project-specific knowledge** - Your codebase conventions and patterns

Panopticon ships with 25+ built-in skills and supports custom skills in `.claude/skills/`.

## Specialists

Specialist agents are AI agents with focused expertise:

- **Review Agent** - Performs comprehensive code reviews
- **Test Agent** - Runs tests and validates functionality
- **Merge Agent** - Handles pull request merging

Specialists work in **convoys** - parallel groups that combine their findings through a synthesis agent.

### Why Specialists?

When a single agent does everything, it must context-switch between:
- Checking for logic errors
- Looking for security vulnerabilities
- Analyzing performance issues

This leads to:
- Shallow reviews (can't go deep on everything)
- Missed issues (focus on one area, miss others)
- Long sequential execution (can't parallelize)

Specialists solve this through **specialization + parallelization**.

## Convoys

Convoys enable multiple AI agents to work in parallel on complex tasks. Instead of a single agent doing everything, specialized agents focus on specific concerns and a synthesis agent combines their findings.

### How Convoys Work

```
pan convoy start code-review --files "src/**/*.ts"
    │
    ├─→ Phase 1 (Parallel): 3 specialized reviewers run simultaneously
    │     ├─→ Correctness (Haiku) → correctness.md
    │     ├─→ Security (Sonnet)    → security.md
    │     └─→ Performance (Haiku)  → performance.md
    │
    └─→ Phase 2 (Sequential): Synthesis agent runs after Phase 1 completes
          → Combines findings, prioritizes issues → REVIEW.md
```

Benefits:
- **10x faster** - Parallel execution instead of sequential
- **Deeper analysis** - Each agent focuses on their domain
- **Better coverage** - No missed issues from context-switching

### Built-in Convoy Templates

| Template | Agents | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `code-review` | correctness, security, performance, synthesis | Comprehensive code review |
| `planning` | planner | Codebase exploration and planning |
| `triage` | (dynamic) | Parallel issue triage |
| `health-monitor` | monitor | Check health of running agents |

## Issue Tracker Integration

Panopticon integrates with popular issue trackers:

- **Linear** - Full integration with cycles, labels, and status updates
- **GitHub Issues** - Issue tracking and PR management
- **GitLab Issues** - Issue tracking and MR management
- **Rally (CA Agile Central)** - Enterprise issue tracking

The dashboard displays issues in a Kanban board with:
- Drag-and-drop status changes
- Cost badges (color-coded by amount)
- Workspace and agent status indicators
- Container status (running/stopped)

### Issue Filtering

The dashboard automatically filters issues to reduce clutter:
- **Linear issues** - Shows current cycle issues only
- **Done column** - Shows items completed in the last 24 hours
- **Canceled column** - Shows items canceled in the last 24 hours
