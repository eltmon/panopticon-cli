# Agent Commands

Spawn, monitor, and control autonomous AI coding agents.

## pan work issue

Spawn an agent for a Linear or GitHub issue.

```bash
# Spawn an agent for a Linear issue
pan work issue MIN-123

# Spawn an agent for a GitHub issue
pan work issue 42
```

This command:
1. Creates a workspace (git worktree) if it doesn't exist
2. Spawns an autonomous agent in a tmux session
3. The agent reads the issue, explores the codebase, and implements the solution

## pan work status

List all running agents and their status.

```bash
pan work status
```

Shows:
- Agent session ID
- Issue number and title
- Current status
- Runtime duration
- Workspace location

## pan work tell

Send a message to a running agent.

```bash
# Send a message to an agent (handles Enter key automatically)
pan work tell min-123 "Please also add tests"
```

This command:
- Sends your message to the agent's tmux session
- The agent receives it and responds accordingly
- Useful for providing feedback, clarification, or guidance

## pan work kill

Stop a running agent.

```bash
pan work kill min-123
```

Terminates the agent's tmux session. The workspace and any uncommitted work remain intact.

## pan work pending

Show work completed and awaiting review.

```bash
pan work pending
```

Lists issues where agents have finished work but haven't been approved yet.

## pan work approve

Approve agent work, merge MR, and update issue tracker.

```bash
pan work approve min-123
```

This command:
1. Spawns a merge-agent specialist
2. Reviews the changes
3. Merges the pull/merge request
4. Updates the issue status

## pan work list

List issues from configured trackers.

```bash
pan work list
```

Shows issues from Linear, GitHub, or GitLab based on your configuration.

## pan work triage

Triage issues from secondary tracker.

```bash
pan work triage
```

Process issues from a secondary tracker (e.g., Rally) and create equivalent issues in your primary tracker.

## pan work reopen

Reopen a closed issue and re-run planning.

```bash
pan work reopen min-123
```

Reopens the issue in your tracker and restarts the planning session.

## pan work request-review

Request re-review after fixing feedback.

```bash
pan work request-review min-123 -m "Fixed: added tests and removed duplication"
```

For agents, this command has a maximum of 3 auto-requeues to prevent infinite loops.

## pan work wipe

Deep wipe: completely reset all state for an issue.

```bash
# Clean up agents, state, Linear status
pan work wipe min-123

# Also delete workspace
pan work wipe min-123 -w

# Skip confirmation
pan work wipe min-123 -y -w
```

This is a nuclear option that:
- Kills any running agents
- Cleans up state files
- Updates issue tracker status
- Optionally removes the workspace

## pan work recover

Recover crashed agents.

```bash
# Recover a specific agent
pan work recover min-123

# Recover all crashed agents
pan work recover --all
```

Attempts to resume agents that crashed or were interrupted.
