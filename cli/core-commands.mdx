# Core Commands

Core system management commands for Panopticon.

## pan install

Install prerequisites and perform first-time setup.

```bash
# Full install (includes Traefik + mkcert for HTTPS)
pan install

# Minimal install (skip Traefik, use ports)
pan install --minimal
```

This command:
- Installs ttyd (web terminal)
- Installs beads CLI (task tracking)
- Optionally sets up Traefik and mkcert for HTTPS
- Creates necessary configuration directories
- Sets up git hooks for registered projects

## pan sync

Sync skills and configuration to all AI tools.

```bash
pan sync
```

This command:
- Copies skills from `~/.panopticon/skills/` to AI tool directories
- Updates Claude Code skills in `~/.claude/skills/`
- Syncs to Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity
- Installs/updates git hooks in all registered projects

Run this after:
- Installing Panopticon
- Updating skills
- Adding new projects
- Upgrading Panopticon

## pan doctor

Check system health and configuration.

```bash
pan doctor
```

Checks:
- Node.js version (18+ required)
- Git installation
- Docker installation and status
- tmux installation
- Required CLI tools (gh, glab)
- Configuration files
- API key validity
- Workspace health
- Traefik status (if installed)

Returns a health report with recommendations for any issues found.

## pan up

Start the Panopticon dashboard and services.

```bash
# Start with default settings
pan up

# Minimal mode (without Traefik)
pan up --minimal
```

Starts:
- **Frontend** - React dashboard (default: http://localhost:3010)
- **API Server** - Backend API (default: http://localhost:3011)
- **Traefik** - Reverse proxy (if installed)

With HTTPS enabled:
- Dashboard: https://pan.localhost
- Traefik UI: https://traefik.pan.localhost:8080

The dashboard provides:
- Kanban board of issues
- Agent monitoring
- Real-time activity logs
- Cost tracking
- Skills browser
- Health checks

## pan down

Stop the dashboard and services gracefully.

```bash
pan down
```

This command:
- Stops the frontend and API server
- Optionally stops Traefik
- Does NOT stop running agents (use `pan work kill` for that)
- Does NOT affect workspaces or containers

Agents continue running independently in tmux sessions.

## pan restart

Restart the dashboard (frontend and API server).

```bash
pan restart
```

This is a clean restart that:
- Kills old processes
- Frees ports (3010, 3011)
- Waits for API health check
- Starts fresh instances

Use this when:
- Dashboard becomes unresponsive
- API is not responding
- After upgrading Panopticon
- To clear any stuck state

## pan health

Check the health of all Panopticon services.

```bash
pan health
```

Shows status of:
- Dashboard (frontend) - Running/stopped
- API server - Running/stopped + health endpoint check
- Traefik - Running/stopped (if installed)
- Running agents - Count and session IDs
- Workspaces - Count and disk usage
- Docker containers - Count and status

Returns:
- Exit code 0 if all services healthy
- Exit code 1 if any service is down

Useful for:
- Pre-flight checks before spawning agents
- Monitoring in automation scripts
- Troubleshooting issues
