# Panopticon CLI

Multi-agent orchestration for AI coding assistants.

> *"The Panopticon had six sides, one for each of the Founders of Gallifrey..."*

## Overview

Panopticon is a unified orchestration layer for AI coding assistants. It works with:

| Tool | Support |
|------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | Full support |
| **Codex** | Skills sync |
| **Cursor** | Skills sync |
| **Gemini CLI** | Skills sync |
| **Google Antigravity** | Skills sync |

### Features

- **Multi-agent orchestration** - Spawn and manage multiple AI agents in tmux sessions
- **Cloister AI Lifecycle Manager** - Automatic model routing, stuck detection, and specialist handoffs
- **Universal skills** - One SKILL.md format works across all supported tools
- **Heartbeat Hooks** - Real-time agent activity monitoring via Claude Code hooks
- **Multi-project support** - YAML-based project registry with label-based issue routing
- **Health Monitoring** - Deacon-style stuck detection with auto-recovery
- **Context Engineering** - Structured state management (STATE.md, WORKSPACE.md)
- **Agent CVs** - Work history tracking for capability-based routing
- **Google Stitch Integration** - AI-powered UI design with automatic design-to-code workflows

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Panopticon
npm install -g panopticon-cli

# Install prerequisites and setup
pan install

# Start the dashboard
pan up
```

Visit [localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) to see your dashboard.

## Dashboard

Start the dashboard with:

```bash
pan up
```

The dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for managing AI agents and workspaces.

### Dashboard Tabs

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Board** | Kanban view of Linear issues with drag-and-drop status changes |
| **Agents** | Running agent sessions with terminal output |
| **Activity** | Real-time `pan` command output log |
| **Metrics** | Runtime comparison and cost tracking |
| **Skills** | Available skills and their descriptions |
| **Health** | System health checks and diagnostics |

### Issue Filtering

The dashboard automatically filters issues to reduce visual clutter:

- **Linear issues** - Shows current cycle issues only
- **Done column** - Shows items completed in the last 24 hours
- **Canceled column** - Shows items canceled in the last 24 hours

This filtering applies to both Linear and GitHub issues. Older completed items are excluded from the dashboard but remain in your issue tracker.

### Issue Cards

Issue cards on the Kanban board display:

- **Cost badges** - Color-coded by amount ($0-5 green, $5-20 yellow, $20+ red)
- **Container status** - Shows if workspace has Docker containers (running/stopped)
- **Agent status** - Indicates if an agent is currently working on the issue
- **Workspace status** - Shows if workspace exists, is corrupted, or needs creation

### Workspace Actions

Click an issue card to open the workspace detail panel:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Create Workspace** | Creates git worktree for the issue |
| **Containerize** | Adds Docker containers to an existing workspace |
| **Start Containers** | Starts stopped Docker containers |
| **Start Planning** | Opens interactive planning session with AI |
| **Start Agent** | Spawns autonomous agent in tmux |
| **Approve & Merge** | Triggers merge-agent to handle PR merge |

### Interactive Planning

The planning dialog provides a real-time terminal for collaborative planning:

- **Discovery questions** - AI asks clarifying questions before implementation
- **Codebase exploration** - AI reads files and understands patterns
- **Pull/Push buttons** - Git operations to share planning context with teammates
- **AskUserQuestion rendering** - Questions from the AI appear as interactive prompts

### Metrics & Cost Tracking

The **Metrics** tab provides insights into AI agent performance and costs:

- **Per-issue cost badges** - See costs directly on Kanban cards (color-coded by amount)
- **Issue cost breakdown** - Click an issue to see detailed costs by model and session
- **Runtime comparison** - Compare success rates, duration, and costs across runtimes (Claude, Codex, etc.)
- **Capability analysis** - See how different task types (feature, bugfix, refactor) perform

Cost data is stored in `~/.panopticon/`:
- `session-map.json` - Links Claude Code sessions to issues
- `runtime-metrics.json` - Aggregated runtime performance data
- `costs/` - Raw cost logs

**API Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/costs/summary` | Overall cost summary (today/week/month) |
| `GET /api/costs/by-issue` | Costs grouped by issue |
| `GET /api/issues/:id/costs` | Cost details for a specific issue |
| `GET /api/metrics/runtimes` | Runtime comparison metrics |
| `GET /api/metrics/tasks` | Recent task history |
