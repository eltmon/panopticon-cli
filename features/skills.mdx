# Skills System

Panopticon's skills system provides reusable workflows and best practices for AI agents.

## What Are Skills

Skills are reusable, shareable workflows that encode best practices for common development tasks. They are:

- **Universal** - Work across all AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- **Shareable** - Distribute via `pan sync` to sync to all connected AI tools
- **Contextual** - Invoked with `/skill-name` in AI tool prompts
- **Best-practice-driven** - Encode proven workflows and checklists

Skills eliminate the need to repeatedly explain how to do common tasks. Instead of telling an agent "please review this code for security issues", you invoke `/code-review-security` and the agent follows the established workflow.

## Built-In Skills

Panopticon includes dozens of built-in skills organized by category:

## Using Skills

Skills are invoked via slash commands in any AI coding tool:

```
# In Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc:
/feature-work
/code-review-security
/bug-fix
/pan-help
```

When you invoke a skill, the AI tool injects the skill's prompt into the conversation, giving the agent detailed instructions on how to proceed.

## Creating Custom Skills

Skills are markdown files stored in `~/.panopticon/skills/`. Create your own with:

```bash
# Use the guided skill creator
/pan-skill-creator

# Or manually create a skill
mkdir -p ~/.panopticon/skills/my-custom-skill
cat > ~/.panopticon/skills/my-custom-skill/skill.md <<'EOF'
# My Custom Skill

- /complementary-skill - Use together with this
```

See the [skill-creator skill](/cli/core-commands) or use `/pan-skill-creator` for guided creation.

## Skill Distribution

Skills can be distributed via:

1. **Project-specific** - Store in `.panopticon/skills/` in your repo
2. **User-specific** - Store in `~/.panopticon/skills/` (synced to AI tools)
3. **Team-shared** - Commit to version control and share via git
4. **Public packages** - Distribute via npm or GitHub

### Syncing Skills

```bash
# Sync all skills to AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
pan sync

# Only sync skills (skip agents, hooks)
pan sync --skills-only

# Verify sync status
pan sync --dry-run
```

The `pan sync` command:
- Copies skills from `~/.panopticon/skills/` to each AI tool's config directory
- Updates existing skills if versions differ
- Preserves local customizations (doesn't overwrite modified files)

## Subagents

Panopticon includes specialized subagent templates for common development tasks. Subagents are invoked via the Task tool or convoy orchestration for parallel execution.

### Code Review Subagents

| Subagent | Model | Focus | Output |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| `code-review-correctness` | haiku | Logic errors, edge cases, type safety | `.claude/reviews/<timestamp>-correctness.md` |
| `code-review-security` | sonnet | OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities | `.claude/reviews/<timestamp>-security.md` |
| `code-review-performance` | haiku | Algorithms, N+1 queries, memory | `.claude/reviews/<timestamp>-performance.md` |
| `code-review-synthesis` | sonnet | Combines all findings into unified report | `.claude/reviews/<timestamp>-synthesis.md` |

**Usage Example:**
```bash
/pan-code-review --files "src/auth/*.ts"
```

This spawns all three reviewers in parallel, then synthesizes their findings into a prioritized report.

### Planning & Exploration Subagents

| Subagent | Model | Focus | Permission Mode |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| `planning-agent` | sonnet | Codebase research, execution planning | `plan` (read-only) |
| `codebase-explorer` | haiku | Fast architecture discovery, pattern finding | `plan` (read-only) |
| `triage-agent` | haiku | Issue categorization, complexity estimation | default |
| `health-monitor` | haiku | Agent stuck detection, log analysis | default |

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Explore codebase architecture
Task(subagent_type='codebase-explorer', prompt='Map out the authentication system')

# Triage an issue
Task(subagent_type='triage-agent', prompt='Categorize and estimate ISSUE-123')

# Check agent health
Task(subagent_type='health-monitor', prompt='Check status of all running agents')
```

## Best Practices

**When creating skills:**
- **Be specific** - Include exact commands, not just concepts
- **Include examples** - Show concrete usage patterns
- **Add checklists** - Help agents verify completion
- **Cross-reference** - Link to related skills and guides
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify skills work end-to-end

**When using skills:**
- **Invoke early** - Start with a skill, don't switch mid-task
- **Follow fully** - Don't skip steps or customize on-the-fly
- **Report issues** - If a skill doesn't work, improve it
- **Combine wisely** - Some skills complement each other, others conflict
