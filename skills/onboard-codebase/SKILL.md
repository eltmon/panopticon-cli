# Codebase Onboarding

## 1. High-Level Structure
- Read README.md
- Map directory structure
- Identify main entry points

## 2. Tech Stack
- What languages/frameworks?
- What build tools?
- What testing frameworks?
- What CI/CD?

## 3. Architecture Patterns
- How is code organized? (layers, modules, services)
- How does data flow?
- What are the key abstractions?

## 4. Development Workflow
- How to run locally?
- How to run tests?
- How to deploy?

## 5. Document Findings
Create a summary with:
- Architecture diagram (ASCII or mermaid)
- Key files and their purposes
- Common patterns used
- Gotchas and quirks
