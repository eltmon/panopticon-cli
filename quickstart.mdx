title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with Panopticon in minutes
---

# Quick Start

Get Panopticon set up and create your first autonomous agent workspace.

## Installation

```bash
# Install Panopticon
npm install -g panopticon-cli

# Install prerequisites and setup (includes optional HTTPS/Traefik)
pan install

# Sync skills to all AI tools
pan sync

# Check system health
pan doctor
```

## HTTPS Setup (Optional)

Panopticon supports local HTTPS via Traefik reverse proxy:

```bash
# Full install (includes Traefik + mkcert for HTTPS)
pan install

# Add to /etc/hosts (macOS/Linux)
echo "127.0.0.1 pan.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# Start with HTTPS
pan up
# → Dashboard: https://pan.localhost
# → Traefik UI: https://traefik.pan.localhost:8080
```

**Minimal install** (skip Traefik, use ports):
```bash
pan install --minimal
pan up
# → Dashboard: http://localhost:3010
```

See [Docker & HTTPS Setup](/guides/docker-setup) for detailed DNS configuration (especially for WSL2).

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| **Linux** | Full support |
| **macOS** | Full support |
| **Windows** | WSL2 required |

> **Windows users:** Panopticon requires WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2). Native Windows is not supported. [Install WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Requirements

### Required
- Node.js 18+
- Git (for worktree-based workspaces)
- Docker (for Traefik and workspace containers)
- tmux (for agent sessions)
- **ttyd** - Web terminal for interactive planning sessions. Auto-installed by `pan install`.
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - For GitHub integration (issues, PRs, merges). [Install](https://cli.github.com/)
- **GitLab CLI (`glab`)** - For GitLab integration (if using GitLab). [Install](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli)

### Optional
- **mkcert** - For HTTPS certificates (recommended)
- **Linear API key** - For issue tracking integration
- **Beads CLI (bd)** - For persistent task tracking across sessions. Auto-installed by `pan install`. Upgrade with `pan beads upgrade`.
- **Google Stitch MCP** - For AI-powered UI design integration

### Platform Support

The Panopticon dashboard includes terminal streaming, which requires a native binary (`node-pty`). Prebuilt binaries are available for:

| Platform | Architecture | Support |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| macOS | Intel (x64) | ✅ Prebuilt |
| macOS | Apple Silicon (arm64) | ✅ Prebuilt |
| Linux | x64 (glibc) | ✅ Prebuilt |
| Linux | arm64 (glibc) | ✅ Prebuilt |
| Linux | musl (Alpine) | ✅ Prebuilt |
| Windows | x64 | ✅ Prebuilt |

If a prebuilt binary is not available for your platform, node-gyp will automatically compile from source during installation (requires Python and build tools).

### Why CLI tools instead of API tokens?

Panopticon uses `gh` and `glab` CLIs instead of raw API tokens because:
- **Better auth**: OAuth tokens that auto-refresh (no expiring PATs)
- **Simpler setup**: `gh auth login` handles everything
- **Agent-friendly**: Agents can use them for PRs, merges, reviews
