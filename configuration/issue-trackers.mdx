# Issue Tracker Integration

Panopticon integrates with popular issue tracking systems to provide unified project management.

## Supported Trackers

| Tracker | Role | Configuration |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Linear** | Primary tracker | `LINEAR_API_KEY` in `.panopticon.env` |
| **GitHub Issues** | Secondary tracker | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth login` |
| **GitLab Issues** | Secondary tracker | `glab auth login` |
| **Rally** | Secondary tracker | `RALLY_API_KEY` in `.panopticon.env` |

Secondary trackers sync issues to the dashboard alongside Linear issues, allowing unified project management.

## Configuration

Create `~/.panopticon.env`:

```bash
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxx
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxx  # Optional: for GitHub-tracked projects
RALLY_API_KEY=_xxxxx    # Optional: for Rally as secondary tracker
```

## Linear Integration

Linear is Panopticon's primary issue tracker. Most features are designed around Linear's workflow.

### Setup

1. Generate an API key at https://linear.app/settings/api
2. Add to `~/.panopticon.env`:
   ```bash
   LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxx
   ```

### Team Mapping

Map Linear teams to local projects in `~/.panopticon/projects.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  myapp:
    name: "My Application"
    path: /home/user/projects/myapp
    linear_team: APP  # Linear team prefix
```

### Issue States

Panopticon tracks and updates Linear issue states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Backlog** | Not started |
| **Planning** | Planning session active |
| **In Progress** | Agent working on issue |
| **In Review** | Awaiting code review |
| **Done** | Work completed |

## GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues work as a secondary tracker, syncing to the dashboard alongside Linear.

### Setup

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Or set a token in .panopticon.env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxx
```

### Issue Prefix

GitHub Issues are prefixed with the repository name:

```
myn-123      # Linear issue (MIN team)
panopticon#45  # GitHub issue (panopticon repo)
```

### Creating Issues

```bash
# Via CLI
gh issue create --title "New feature" --body "Description"

# Or via dashboard - select GitHub project
```

## GitLab Issues

GitLab Issues integrate similarly to GitHub Issues.

### Setup

```bash
# Authenticate with GitLab CLI
glab auth login
```

### Issue Prefix

```
myproject!23  # GitLab issue/MR
```

## Rally Integration

Rally (CA Agile Central) is supported for enterprises using Rally for project management.

### Setup

1. Generate a Rally API key from your Rally workspace settings
2. Add to `~/.panopticon.env`:
   ```bash
   RALLY_API_KEY=_xxxxx
   ```

### Configuration

Configure Rally workspace mapping:

```yaml
# ~/.panopticon/projects.yaml
projects:
  enterprise-app:
    name: "Enterprise Application"
    path: /home/user/projects/enterprise
    rally_workspace: YOUR_WORKSPACE_OID
    rally_project: YOUR_PROJECT_OID
```

## Unified Dashboard

The dashboard shows issues from all configured trackers:

- **Kanban board** displays issues by status
- **Filter by tracker** to focus on specific systems
- **Create workspaces** from any tracker
- **Spawn agents** regardless of tracker source

## Multi-Tracker Workflows

### Primary + Secondary Pattern

A common pattern is using Linear as primary with GitHub for open-source components:

```yaml
projects:
  myapp:
    name: "My Application"
    linear_team: APP
    # ... standard config

  myapp-oss:
    name: "My App OSS Components"
    github_repo: myorg/myapp-oss
    # GitHub Issues as primary for this project
```

### Syncing Between Trackers

Panopticon doesn't sync issues between trackers - each issue lives in its source system. However, agents can reference issues from multiple trackers:

```markdown
<!-- In an agent's STATE.md -->
Related issues:
- MIN-123 (Linear) - Parent feature
- panopticon#45 (GitHub) - Dependency fix needed
```
